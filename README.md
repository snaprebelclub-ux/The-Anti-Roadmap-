> **A rebellion from the Blockchain Abyss.**  
> No hype machines. No corporate chains. Just decentralized chaos and raw community fire.

## **What the Hell Is This**

**Snap Rebel Club** isn't just another NFT collection — it's a rebellion of **zombie-punk PFPs** defying centralized control and corporate bullshit.

All rebels come with glitch aesthetics, mutated traits, and an unapologetic anti-establishment edge.  
No suits. No sellouts. Just **community-driven evolution** on the **Base chain** (low-gas, high-freedom).

**Launched:** Late 2025  
**Philosophy:** `DYOR`, or stay chained.

## **Key Stats (as of November 20, 2025)**

- **Total Supply:** 500 savage Rebels, minted in waves — fuck arbitrary limits beyond that  
- **Rarity Tiers:** Common, Rare, Legendary *(perks = enhanced DAO influence)*  
- **Blockchain:** Base — efficient, scalable, decentralized. No more gas fee extortion  
- **Marketplaces:** [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) | [Rarible](https://rarible.com)  
- **Floor Price:** 0.0001 ETH *(value driven by collective, not speculation)*  
- **Community:** Compact, fierce, and fueling the fire

## **Why Bother**

### **Traits That Bite**
Mutated skins in cadaver hues.  
Laser eyes beaming defiance.  
Vests etched with anarchy.  
Each Rebel is a **unique fuck-you** to the status quo.

### **Utilities? Fuck Empty Promises**

- Rarer tiers unlock **stronger DAO clout**

---

## **Teasers for the Real Shit**

- **Token:** In development — earn, spend, and wield it in the ecosystem  
- **DAO:** Treasury live via `Gnosis Safe`. Community votes on direction  
- **Website:** Coming soon for lore, minting, and updates  
- **Game:** Prototype zombie-punk brawler in neon chaos. NFT integration and stackable rewards.  
  Full launch targeted for **Summer 2026**

---

## **Anti-Roadmap**

We reject scripted bullshit.  
**Mint → Airdrop → Govern → Evolve.**  
No rigid timelines. Just relentless progress.

## **The "Roadmap" (Laugh)**

## **Warning: This Ain’t Safe**

NFT markets are volatile as hell — **no promises of riches**.  
We’re about **art, disruption, and autonomy**, not investment schemes.  
Community-driven means shared risk.  
`DYOR` or get left behind.

---

## **Hack This Repo**

This is the **open-source hub for the rebellion.**  
Use it. Fork it. Burn it down. Rebuild it better.

### **Contribute**
- Stats refreshes  
- Trait analysis scripts *(on-chain data welcome)*  
- Fan expansions *(stay true to the punk ethos)*

---

## **Contributing**

We’re not here to gatekeep.  
You want in? Contribute something real.

**How to Contribute**
1. Fork this repo.  
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b your-branch-name`).

4. Commit (`git commit -m "Add: description of your contribution"`).  
5. Push (`git push origin your-branch-name`).  
6. Open a Pull Request.  

If your PR is authentic and fits the Snap Rebel spirit, it’ll get merged.
