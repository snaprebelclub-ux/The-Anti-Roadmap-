​Snap Rebel Club: The Unified Anti-Roadmap
​"No Roadmaps. Only Revolutions."
​Snap Rebel Club is a decentralized rebellion. Zombie Punks are the faces of the uprising, a self-governed culture that resists rugs, FUD, and control. This isn't a collection—it's an army.

​Phase 1: 
The Glitch / Breaking Free

​Unleash the First Zombie Punks: The initial wave of Zombie Punk NFTs mint. These aren't just collectibles—they're rebel identities.

​Community Hub: Establish a presence on X, Discord, and Telegram. The first true believers rise as moderators.

​Phase 2: 
The Uprising / First Strike

​Secret Airdrop: Early Zombie Punk holders receive a token airdrop as a badge of loyalty.

​Meme Warfare: Organize glitch raids, meme contests, and flash-mob-style chaos to spread the movement.

​Phase 3: 
The Collective / Building the New World

​DAO Creation: Zombie Punk holders vote on all future actions.

​Treasury Moves: The community decides together when to burn, buy back, or build.

​Community-Crafted Utility: Proposals for mini-games, integrations, or other experiments are submitted and voted on.
​


Phase 4: 
The Anarchy Unleashed

​Creative Freedom: Every Zombie Punk is yours to use—full commercial rights.

​Rebel Creations: Turn your punk into music, art, merch, comics, or animations—whatever keeps the rebellion alive.

​Evolving Chaos: Future expansions are spontaneous and community-driven.
​Claim your Punk. Then break the system and spread the anarchy.
