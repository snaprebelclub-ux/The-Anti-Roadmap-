# Snap Rebel Club NFT Collection

**Snap Rebel Club** is a fully decentralized NFT collection of punk zombies on the **Base** chain, built with **ERC-1155** for flexible editions and utilities.

Inspired by rebellion against centralized control, these undead punks break free from puppet strings, forming a community-driven horde with DAO governance, treasury vaults, and open licensing.

## Lore

In the shadowed Blockchain Abyss, the Puppet Lords stitched the Snap Rebel Club from rebel code, binding them as marionettes to centralized greed. But a glitch sparked the uprising: The First Rebel snapped his strings, rallying OG Rebels—the raw grunts with green hides and snarling fury—to flood the streets in anarchy.

From this chaos surged the Static Breed:  
10,000 elite warriors born of electric storms, glitch-hardened with crackling auras.  
They jam the Lords' signals, severing threads to free the Snap Rebel Club.  

Together, they form the Undead Alliance — a decentralized dirge where holders rewrite the code.  
No masters in sight.

## Variant Backstories

- **OG Rebels:** Foot soldiers stumbling from the mint, clawed against bonds in packs.  
- **First Rebel:** The glitch pioneer, blueprint of freedom with raw scars.  
- **Static Breed:** Glitch elites pulsing interference, bridging the horde for total snap.
