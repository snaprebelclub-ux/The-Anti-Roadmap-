Snap Rebel Club NFT Collection
Overview
Snap Rebel Club is a fully decentralized NFT collection of punk zombies on the Base chain, built with ERC-1155 for flexible editions and utilities. Inspired by rebellion against centralized control, these undead punks break free from puppet strings, forming a community-driven horde with DAO governance, treasury vaults, and open licensing. The project emphasizes anti-roadmap anarchy, where holders vote on evolutions, airdrops, and cross-collection alliances.
Launched in September 2025, Snap Rebel Club starts with limited mints (e.g., OG Rebels, Legendaries) and expands via phases like "The Glitch / Breaking Free." Total supply targets 100 unique characters over a year, with editions per rarity (e.g., 100 commons each). The companion "Static Breed" drop adds 10,000 glitchborn warriors as elite soldiers in the lore.

Lore
In the shadowed Blockchain Abyss, the Puppet Lords stitched the Snap Rebel Club from rebel code, binding them as marionettes to centralized greed. But a glitch sparked the uprising: The First Rebel snapped his strings, rallying OG Rebels‚Äîthe raw grunts with green hides and snarling fury‚Äîto flood the streets in anarchy.
From this chaos surged the Static Breed: 10,000 elite warriors born of electric storms, glitch-hardened with crackling auras. As vanguard soldiers, they jam the Lords' signals, severing threads to free the Snap Rebel Club. Together, they form the Undead Alliance‚Äîa decentralized dirge where holders rewrite the code, no masters in sight.
Variant Backstories
OG Rebels: Foot soldiers stumbling from the mint, clawed against bonds in packs.
First Rebel: The glitch pioneer, blueprint of freedom with raw scars.
Static Breed: Glitch elites pulsing interference, bridging the horde for total snap.
